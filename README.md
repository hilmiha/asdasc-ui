# ðŸš§ ASDASC ðŸš§ 

**Another Scalable Design And Stuff, Components**


A React component collection built from years of front-end development experience and my journey of learning how to create my own components from scratch.

### What is ASDASC?

ASDASC is my personal exploration into building React components the way I think they should work. It's not about reinventing the wheel, but it's about understanding how the wheel is made and building one that fits my specific needs and preferences.

### Features

ðŸŽ¨ Flexible Theming

- **Light & Dark modes** (and everything in between)
- **Color-tone based themes** - Life is not just black and white, but filled with colors
- **Plenty of colors to choose from** - Swatches galore
- **Easy to custom colors variables** for maximum flexibility

ðŸ”§ Three Design Systems

- **Rounded corners** - For that friendly, modern feel
- **Pill/Circle** - When you want things smooth and flowing
- **Boxed corners** - Sharp, clean, and professional

â™¿ Keyboard Accessibility And Color Contrast

- **Keyboard navigation** - Tab through everything like a pro
- **Color contrast compliance** - Text that's actually readable
- **Focus management** - Visual indicators that make sense

ðŸ§© Developer Experience
- **TypeScript support** - Because we're not animals
- **Customizable components** - Tweak everything
- **Modular and atomic architecture** - Components built from small things to complete components

### Why Build My Own Components?

Here's the honest answer:

I wanted to understand how to build components from the ground up. This project is my learning journey:

- Understanding component architecture and patterns
- Implementing proper theming systems
- Building accessibility into components from day one
- Creating flexible APIs that actually make sense
- Learning the intricacies of design systems

ASDASC is my attempt to apply everything I've learned about front-end development into creating components that work the way I think they should.




### Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hilmiha/asdasc-ui.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd asdasc-ui
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Philosophy

- **Learning by building** - The best way to understand components is to create them
- **Practical implementation** - Every feature exists because I needed to figure out how to build it
- **Accessibility as education** - Learning to build inclusive components from the start
- **Personal growth** - Each component teaches me something new about React and design systems
- **Real-world application** - Built while learning, tested by using

Keep in mind: this is my journey of learning how to build components, so expect some experimentation and iteration along the way.
